# stable-diffusion-webui-easy-raw
Takes raw parameters you might have copied from a website or Discord into the prompt window and applies them without having to copy&paste multiple times. 

Currently WIP. Only works consistently with Civitai prompts.
Setting sampler and upscaler automatically does not work at the moment and you will have to manually check hires-fix to enable the changed parameters.
